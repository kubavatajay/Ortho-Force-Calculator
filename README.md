# Ortho-Force-Calculator
The Ortho Biomechanics AI Calculator is an interactive web tool bridging materials science and clinical orthodontics. It dynamically calculates active forces delivered to the periodontal ligament, models non-linear superelasticity of NiTi wires, and evaluates critical contact angles for friction. Built for orthodontic research and higher education.
